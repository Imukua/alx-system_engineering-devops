# Loops, conditions and parsing
  in this project I was expected to grasp the following concepts:

    * How to create SSH keys
    * What is the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/ bash
    * How to use while, until and for loops
    * How to use if, else, elif and case condition statements
    * How to use the cut command
    * What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them

## Tasks🗒️
#### 0. Create a SSH RSA key pair🚀
- created a RSA key pair.
- saved the public key in [0-RSA_public_key.pub](./0-RSA_public_key.pub)

#### 1. For Best School loop🚀
- A Bash script that uses `for` loop to display `Best School` 10 times.
- Implemeted in [1-for_best_school](./1-for_best_school)

#### 2. while best school🚀
- A bash script thar uses `while` loop to display `Best School` 10 times.
- implemented in [2-while_best_school](./2-while_best_school)

#### 3. until best school🚀
- A bash script that uses `untill` to display `Best school` 10 times.
- Implemented in [3-until_best_school](./3-until_best_school)

#### 4. If 9, say Hi! 🚀
- Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times, but for the 9th iteration, 
  displays Best School and then `Hi` on a new line.

- Requirements:🔒 
  - You must use the `while` loop (for and until are forbidden)
  - You must use the `if` statement

- Implemented in [4-if_9_say_hi](./4-if_9_say_hi)

  
#### 5. 4 bad luck, 8 is your chance🚀
- Write a Bash script that loops from 1 to 10 and:
  - displays `bad luck` for the 4th loop iteration
  - displays `good luck` for the 8th loop iteration
  - displays `Best School` for the other iterations

- Requirements:🔒 
  - You must use the while loop (for and until are forbidden)
  - You must use the if, elif and else statements
