Project Tasksüìù
-------------

This project consists of the following tasks:

1.  [OSI modelüöÄ](./0-OSI_model)
- Learn about the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which is an abstract model that describes layered communication and network design.
- Understand the organization of the OSI model and its different layers.

2.  [Types of networküöÄ](./1-types_of_network)
- Explore different types of networks, including LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), and the Internet.
- Understand the characteristics and typical usage of each type of network.

3.  [MAC and IP addressüöÄ](./2-MAC_and_IP_address)
- Learn about MAC (Media Access Control) and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses.
- Understand the role of MAC addresses as unique identifiers for network interfaces and the function of IP addresses as the numerical identifiers for devices on a network.

4.  [UDP and TCPüöÄ](./3-UDP_and_TCP)
- Dive into the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) protocols.
- Understand the differences between them, including their speed and reliability in data transfer.
- Learn about the characteristics and functionality of these protocols.

5.  [TCP and UDP portsüöÄ](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)
- Gain knowledge about TCP and UDP ports, which are used for network communication.
- Learn about the significance of ports in network devices and the concept of sockets.
- Write a Bash script to display listening ports and associated processes.
